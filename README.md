My 27th assignemnt! In this assignment we upgrade the old cookie website with css. I already had almost all of it done for the first project, so in this one I focused on keeping other screen sizes in mind. I also created a separate page for recipe submissions, added a navbar to get around the site, and a button that will take you to the other page as well.
